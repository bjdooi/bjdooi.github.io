AlphaGo is the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, and the first to defeat a Go world champion. AlphaGo Zero tackles the same problem but with a different approach; it is trained completely through its own experiences without data from any external sources (hence the \"Zero\"). Zero is more powerful and efficient than all previous iterations of AlphaGo, and was able to beat the previous strongest version by 100 games to 0. We will present the AlphaGo Zero white paper in an engaging technical presentation and understand how this system works.</p>\n<p>On a separate but equally interesting note, we will discuss the speculative execution exploits Meltdown and Spectre. Meltdown and Spectre exploit a hardware flaw in branch prediction, where the CPU of a computer will make predictions on what it will compute next in order to maximize speed and efficiency. However, this gives a window of opportunity for malicious applications to bypass memory isolation to read and access the contents of the entire memory. We will discuss the implications of this exploit and how it could possibly affect the field of AI.</p>\n<p>===== This is an academic-style journal club where one person chooses a topic or paper and presents it.

While the useful questions concerning sentiment and classification are already considered pretty abstract, researchers have started to ask questions that go a step beyond. Ethical decision making is something that humans themselves cannot even define effectively, yet AI systems have been made to approach this problem. At this meeting we will discuss the implications of this while closely following the MIT white paper \"A Voting-Based System for Ethical Decision Making.\" This paper discusses the decisions a self driving car would make in extreme circumstances, where the ethical decision is decided by the results of online polls taken by random people. Along with this paper, we will discuss systems that claim to be able to identify potential terrorists or criminals, and even someone's sexual orientation, just from their face. Is this a ground breaking application of AI, or just an embellished resurgence of the archaic pseudoscience of physiognomy? This will be an open discussion, so feel free to come in and state your stance!</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IE-Rpn6r7vwBNL5WdaQXyaZpznuxU18EDNZGQXSfccQ/edit?usp=sharing\">Apple's new AI engine</a></h2>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Apple_A11.jpg\" width=\"25%\">\n<!-- ![appleaiengine](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Apple_A11.jpg) -->\n<h3>Description:</h3>\n<p>Apple recently came out with news about their revolutionary custom SoC, the A11 Bionic neural engine. The company boasts up to 600 billion operations per second for real-time processing. The engine allows for many powerful AI uses, along with specific machine learning algorithms that can enable a new wave of smart phone security. Will this new chip actually live up to these claims? Is this mostly marketing fluff or the real deal? At this point we can only speculate, however there are enough technical resources out there that can help us form a better idea, such as apple's coreml documentation. Come to our monthly discussion where we will explore this topic in depth!  </p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Complex-Systems-and-Artificial-Intelligence/events/242683362/\">Monte Carlo Sim.
